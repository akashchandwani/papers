abstract: Entity matching is the problem of identifying which records refer to the
  same real-world entity. It has been actively researched for decades, and a variety
  of different approaches have been developed. Even today, it remains a challenging
  problem, and there is still generous room for improvement. In recent years we have
  seen new methods based upon deep learning techniques for natural language processing
  emerge.   In this survey, we present how neural networks have been used for entity
  matching. Specifically, we identify which steps of the entity matching process existing
  work have targeted using neural networks, and provide an overview of the different
  techniques used at each step. We also discuss contributions from deep learning in
  entity matching compared to traditional methods, and propose a taxonomy of deep
  neural networks for entity matching.
