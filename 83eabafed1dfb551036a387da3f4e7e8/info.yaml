abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often praised for exhibiting near-human
  performance on a wide range of tasks and valued for their ability to hold a general
  conversation. The rise of agentic AI systems is, however, ushering in a mass of
  applications in which language models perform a small number of specialized tasks
  repetitively and with little variation. Here we lay out the position that small
  language models (SLMs) are sufficiently powerful, inherently more suitable, and
  necessarily more economical for many invocations in agentic systems, and are therefore
  the future of agentic AI. Our argumentation is grounded in the current level of
  capabilities exhibited by SLMs, the common architectures of agentic systems, and
  the economy of LM deployment. We further argue that in situations where general-purpose
  conversational abilities are essential, heterogeneous agentic systems (i.e., agents
  invoking multiple different models) are the natural choice. We discuss the potential
  barriers for the adoption of SLMs in agentic systems and outline a general LLM-to-SLM
  agent conversion algorithm. Our position, formulated as a value statement, highlights
  the significance of the operational and economic impact even a partial shift from
  LLMs to SLMs is to have on the AI agent industry. We aim to stimulate the discussion
  on the effective use of AI resources and hope to advance the efforts to lower the
  costs of AI of the present day. Calling for both contributions to and critique of
  our position, we commit to publishing all such correspondence at https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/slm-agents.
